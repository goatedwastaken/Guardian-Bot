do !host (time) in order to declare the time at when it's being hosted. To get a time, use this site: https://r.3v.fi/discord-timestamps/

Additionally: you must go into the code and change values such as your Guild ID, channel ID where the hosts are announced and things such as ruleset, mods, etc.
